## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to a `local.env` file in the root of the project.

`AUTH0_DOMAIN`

`AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`

These environment variables can be obtained by creating a M2M application in your Auth0 tenant. Make sure it is given the permissions to call call the Auth0 Management API.
